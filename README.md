# customer_segmentation
unsupervised learning to group customers by buying habits of categories

In this project, analysis was performed on a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
